# Ansible Projects

I use Ansible to automate configuring servers, installing different tools on them, configuring operating system and deploying applications. This repository shows how Ansible integrates seamlessly with technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins, and cloud platforms:

### Core Ansible Concepts:
**Ansible Inventory**:
   - Define and manage a list of target servers or devices that Ansible will automate.
   - Inventory files (e.g 'hosts' file) to organize the infrastructure.

**Ansible Playbooks**:
   - Create playbooks that define automation tasks and their execution on target systems.

**Ansible Configuration File**:
   - Configure Ansible behavior using configuration files.
   - Customize Ansible's settings to suit specific needs.

### Server Configuration:
- Configure servers running different Linux distributions.
- Work with cloud platforms like AWS, Linode and Digital Ocean to provision and manage infrastructure.

### Ansible Advanced Topics:
1. **Ansible Collections and Ansible Galaxy**:
   - Explore Ansible collections and Ansible Galaxy to extend Ansible's capabilities with pre-built content.
   - Leverage community-contributed Ansible roles and modules.

2. **Ansible Variables**:
   - To make playbooks customizable and adaptable.
   - Various methods for setting variable values in Ansible.

3. **Troubleshooting and Error Handling**:
   - Implement conditional statements and privilege escalation when necessary.

### Dynamic Infrastructure:
- Configure dynamic inventory to dynamically obtain server addresses, eliminating the need for hardcoded values.
- Execute Ansible playbooks seamlessly from Terraform scripts, automating infrastructure provisioning and configuration.

### Docker and Kubernetes Integration:
- Utilize Ansible Docker modules to work with Docker images and containers.
- Automate Kubernetes cluster configuration and deploy components using Ansible.

### Jenkins Integration:
- Integrate Ansible into Jenkins' CI/CD pipeline to automate application deployment.

### Production-Ready Ansible:
- Make Ansible content more reusable and modular using Ansible Roles.
